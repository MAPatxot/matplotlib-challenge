Reason for 2nd Commit: New Bar Graph + %

Re-Read the instructions for the homework, and realized that there were notes provided 
On how to get the percentages to display. Had a hard time initially finding how to do this. 

I added the percentages to display and it showed that the percentages shown were incorrect
Compared to the bar graph that is provided

Reason is because my variables for my individual bar graph plots such as "capo_bar", I was referencing the wrong indexes. For "infu_bar" I had [1] instead of [2], [1] represented Ceftamin.
